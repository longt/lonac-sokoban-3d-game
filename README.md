## How to Add Your Level to the Game

You can send me a direct message on Facebook: [Phan Đức Hải](https://www.facebook.com/chiatayde/) and send me the `data.txt` file.

If you have a GitHub account, you can add your level to the game by following these steps:

Go to https://sokoban-3d.vercel.app/create/

Press `H` to create a file named `data.txt`. Copy the content of this file and follow the instructions.

Access: https://github.dev/zukahai/sokoban-3d-game

Wait for the web page to load, it will appear as shown below:

![Contribute Step 1](./assets/images/contribute1.png)

Select `config.js`, inside it is the current number of levels. You need to increase it by 1. For example, if there are currently 21 levels, you need to change it to 22.

![Contribute Step 2](./assets/images/contribute2.png)

Continue to select `assets`, wait for it to load, then select `levels`. The window will appear as shown below:

![Contribute Step 3](./assets/images/contribute3.png)

Click on the icon as shown below to create a new file named `levelX.json`, where `X` is the number of your level. For example, if you want to create level 22, you need to create the file `level22.json`.
*Note: The GitHub.dev system loads continuously, so sometimes it may not receive the signal to create the file. You need to be patient and perform this operation multiple times if you don't see the system asking for the file name.*

Then paste the content of the `data.txt` file into the newly created `levelX.json` file. Remember to change the `indexLevel` part to `X` in the `levelX.json` file. For example, if you are creating level 22, you need to change it to `var indexLevel = 22;`.

![Contribute Step 5](./assets/images/contribute5.png)

- Switch to the source control tab by selecting the icon as shown below
- Write a message to let me know what you want to do, for example, `add level 22`
- Press the `Commit and push` button

![Contribute Step 6](./assets/images/contribute6.png)

If there is a prompt, select `fork repository` to create a copy of the game on your GitHub.

![Contribute Step 7](./assets/images/contribute7.png)

If the next interface appears, simply select `patch-1` and press `Enter` to create a Pull Request.

Finally, create a Pull Request:<br>Access: https://github.com/zukahai/sokoban-3d-game

![Contribute Step 8](./assets/images/contribute8.png)

Select `Compare & pull request`

![Contribute Step 9](./assets/images/contribute9.png)
